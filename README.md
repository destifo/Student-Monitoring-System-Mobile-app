## General Information

        The product is a web application that will be creating communication between parents and the school community. Teachers 
        and school admins can notify parents attendances,grades and announcements. Each notification can be modified and deleted 
        by an authorized user. This will reduce the backward communication that is face-to-face or that takes throught the mediation 
        of students. Parents will have accounts and passwords to make sure students do not sneak in to the page.

        The mobile app is a getway only for parents and teachers with the same capabilities in the web 
        application. Admins will continue to exercise their works through the web interface. While 
        parents and teachers need the mobility when accessing this service, the mobile app was 
        seen necessary to include for those two actors. Basically, we are building a mobile app for 
        the previous web application we developed excluding the admin.
